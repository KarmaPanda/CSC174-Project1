					<h3>Minor: Linguistics</h3>
					<p>Jason has completed a cluster in Language Structure via the linguistics department. This cluster is defined as one that "focuses on the semantics and pragmatics of natural language and how linguistic forms and their usages give rise to meanings" (<a href="https://secure1.rochester.edu/registrar/CSE/clusterView.php?clusterNumber=S1LIN005" target="_blank">source</a>). In the fall, Jason plans to finish all remaining coursework to turn this cluster into a minor in linguistics.</p>
