			<h2>Joshua Choi</h2>
			<p>My name is Joshua Choi and I'm a junior at the University of Rochester double majoring in computer science and digital media studies. I'm from Closter, New Jersey, which isn't known for anything special besides being right next to New York City. I'm a very visually-oriented person and enjoy doing digital art and photography in my free time. I also grew up playing music and can play the clarinet, saxophone, and the cello.</p>
